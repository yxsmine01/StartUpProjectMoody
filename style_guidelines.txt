Overall Look and Feel of Moody
===============================

We want the overall look of the website to be minimalist. We will avoid 3d buttons and 3d metal looks.
The themes of the website are well-being and mental health; therefore, the website should inspire calmness and peace of mind.

Colours
========
For Moody, colours illustrate our will to ease our customers' lives, as these colors embody the purity of our commitment and transparency in serving them.
These are our color swatches:

- white
- #3B1E54
- #9B7EBD

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using simple icons, in design and color, which adhere to the overall look and feel of the website.

Typography
==========
We will be using Poppins for the text and Modak for the headers. Both fonts are from Google Fonts.

Links
=====
Links will be underlined and blue. When a user clicks on it it should open the link in a new window. When the link has already been used once, its color will become purple.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed with rounded corners. Their color will get darker when we hover on them, adding a subtle shadow for a touch of depth.
