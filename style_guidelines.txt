Overall Look and Feel of Moody
===============================

We want the overall look of the website to be minimalist. We will avoid 3d buttons and 3d metal looks.
The themes of the website are well-being and mental health; therefore, the website should inspire calmness and peace of mind.

Colours
========
For Moody, colours expose our personality to the customers and represent that we are calm and pleasing.
These are our color swatches:

- white
- #3B1E54
- #9B7EBD

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using simple icons, in design and color, which adhere to the overall look and feel of the website.

Typography
==========
We will be using Poppins for the text and Modak for the headers. Both fonts are from Google Fonts.

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and should change color when a user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed using the chosen colors outlined above.
